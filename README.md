# Planty-DB

This is the API to my [Planty eCommerce site](https://github.com/christianwagstaff/shopping-cart). The routing is handled using Express to simplify the requests, and the site is now hosted on Heroku to allow the site to have constant access to its API. The API gets its information from a MongoDB database with requests handled with Mongoose. The link to the database is used via a .env file for protection.
